# CAP

CAP is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers along a ‘golden path’ of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on domain. Instead of delving into overly technical disciplines, CAP focuses on accelerated development and safeguarding investments in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies.

On top of open source technologies, CAP mainly adds:

- Core Data Services (CDS) as our universal modeling language for both domain models and service definitions.

- Service SDK and runtime for Node.js and Java, offering libraries to implement and consume services as well as generic provider implementations serving many requests automatically.
