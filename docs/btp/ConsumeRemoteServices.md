# Consume Remote Services

> Base on project template: [btp-cap-monorepo](../../btp-cap-monorepo/)

how to get an API definition from the SAP API Business Hub, and how to import an API definition to your project.

![](../images/btp/external_service_solution_overview.png)

CAP supports the service consumption with dedicated APIs to import service definitions, query remote services, mash up services, and work locally as long as possible.

> When changed the db defination, you need use command `cds deploy` to redeploy it to database.

## SAP API Business Hub

SAP publishes service definitions for its major products on [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/).

Try to find the service [**Business Partner (A2X)**](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview) and download the edmx file.

In folder [caps/app-store](../../btp-cap-monorepo/caps/app-store/) execute the command import api defination:

`cds import ~/Downloads/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx`

Use the external service in your service definition.

## Connect to the sandbox service

`npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/http-client @sap-cloud-sdk/util`

Add credentials for the external service in profile sandbox:

```json
"API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
    "kind": "odata-v2",
    "model": "srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER",
    "[sandbox]": {
        "credentials": {
        "url": "https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/"
        }
    }
}
```

Run server with profile sandbox: `cds watch --profile sandbox`

### Add the API key

You take an API key from SAP API Business Hub, add it to the credentials in the profile sandbox in file `.cdsrc-private.json`:

```json
{
  "requires": {
    "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
        "[sandbox]": {
            "credentials": {
                "headers": {
                    "APIKey": "your api key"
                }
            }
        }
    }
  }
}
```

### Delegate to the external service

Delegate the odata request to the external service using custom handler:

```typescript
import cds from '@sap/cds'

/**
 * Service implementation for the cds service defined in /srv/risk-service.cds
 *
 */
export default cds.service.impl(async function () {
  const bupa = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER')

  /**
   * delegate request to the remote service
   */
  this.on('READ', 'Suppliers', async (req) => {
    return bupa.run(req.query)
  })

  this.after('READ', 'Risks', (risksData) => {})
})
```

## Add Supplier to Risks entity

Add the association supplier to the entity Risks in file `db/risk-management.cds`:

```javascript
entity Risks : managed {
  ...
  supplier    : Association to Suppliers;
}
```

This managed association adds a property `supplier_ID` to the `Risks` entity under the hood, so that the key and the ID field of the supplier can be stored.

Add the following code to your `src/risk-service-handler.ts` file to handle the expands for supplier data of Risks:

```javascript
// Risks?$expand=supplier
this.on('READ', 'Risks', async (req, next) => {
  if (!req.query.SELECT.columns) return next()
  const expandIndex = req.query.SELECT.columns.findIndex(({ expand, ref }) => expand && ref[0] === 'supplier')
  if (expandIndex < 0) return next()

  // Remove expand from query
  req.query.SELECT.columns.splice(expandIndex, 1)

  // Make sure supplier_ID will be returned
  if (
    !(req.query.SELECT.columns.indexOf('*') >= 0) &&
    !req.query.SELECT.columns.find((column) => column.ref && column.ref.find((ref) => ref == 'supplier_ID'))
  ) {
    req.query.SELECT.columns.push({ ref: ['supplier_ID'] })
  }

  const risks = await next()

  const asArray = (x) => (Array.isArray(x) ? x : [x])

  // Request all associated suppliers
  const supplierIds = asArray(risks).map((risk) => risk.supplier_ID)
  const suppliers = await bupa.run(SELECT.from('RiskService.Suppliers').where({ ID: supplierIds }))

  // Convert in a map for easier lookup
  const suppliersMap = {}
  for (const supplier of suppliers) suppliersMap[supplier.ID] = supplier

  // Add suppliers to result
  for (const note of asArray(risks)) {
    note.supplier = suppliersMap[note.supplier_ID]
  }

  return risks
})
```

The code first makes sure an expand for a supplier is requested. Then, the expand is removed from the query because it canâ€™t be handled by the CAP server generically.

To identify the suppliers that are needed, the risks are read by calling next(). This way, all following handlers are called, including the built-in CAP handler that reads the risks from the database and returns them. The code makes sure that the required supplier_ID field is returned.

All the required suppliers are read with one request from API_BUSINESS_PARTNER service and added to the respective risks.
