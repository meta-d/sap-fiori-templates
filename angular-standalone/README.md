# Angular Template for SAP Fiori Application

## ðŸŒŸ What is this?

This is a template for building SAP Fiori apps with [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework. It is based on [Nx](https://nx.dev) and [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/).

## ðŸ›« Start the app

Before you start, install npm packages by running `npm install`.

To start the development server run `nx serve angular-standalone` or `npm run start`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## âœ¨ How we generate the code?

We use the Nx CLI to generate code `npx create-nx-workspace <sap-fiori-app-name>`.

Then add tailwind use command `npx nx g @nx/angular:setup-tailwind angular-standalone`.

Add UI library [Ant Design of Angular](https://ng.ant.design/) ng-zorro-antd use command `npx nx g @nx/angular:ng-add ng-zorro-antd --style=less`. 



## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
